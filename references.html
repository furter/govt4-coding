    <h4>Online Reading</h4>
    <p><a href="http://readquickapp.com">Readquick</a>: “With ReadQuick you can read faster and comprehend more than you ever have before.” The app displays text word per word, to enable ‘speed-reading’.</p>
    <p>After a period in the 1990ies where designers were heavily experimenting with User Interfaces (not only in HTML, but also with tools as Flash) the age of the Wordpress-like content management systems and the advance of template driven design has created certain expectations about what type read online should be like. For those designs not confirming to these expectations, tools like <a href="https://www.readability.com/">Readability</a> and Safari’s Reader Function allow to reformat websites’ texts to a more ‘readable’ design.</p>
    <p>Another important medium for digital texts are digital books. The main open format is ePub. The mainstream interfaces for reading such books (ePubs) is similar throughout apps such as iBooks and Adobe Digital Editions, and the Open Source Readium project. All books are presented in a similar design, and the user has the option to change such details as font size, typeface and background color, often from a range of pre-sets. <a href="http://readium.org/projects/readiumjs" title="ReadiumJS | Readium">Readium.js</a> is an Open Source implementation of an interface in such a paradigm.</p>

        <a href="http://dronestre.am/" TARGET="_blank">Drone app</a>, see also <a href="http://www.wired.com/2012/08/drone-app/">Apple Rejects App That Tracks U.S. Drone Strikes</a> in Wired.<br>	
    </p>
    
    <p>This App was rejected by Apple multiple times, one of these rejections state:</p>
    
    <blockquote>We found that your app contains content that many audiences would find objectionable, which is not in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines,</blockquote>
    
    <p>Internally the app uses an API. An API is a standardised way to talk to another program, most commonly a web service. Dronestrike’s API is also available for other apps to use, on <a href="http://api.dronestre.am/data">http://api.dronestre.am/data</a>.This is an example of a drone-strike formatted as JSON, one of the standardised exchange formats internet.</p>
