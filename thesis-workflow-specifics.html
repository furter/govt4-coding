            <p>You have probably experienced how messy it is to get a Word document into inDesign; this is the same with HTML. There is no straightforward way, it always comes down to a bit of ‘bricolage’. Microsoft Word might allow one to save a file as an HTML document, but the resulting HTML will be too messy too use. Possible solutions:</p> <!-- This is the paragraph! The main unit of text. You can add margin after a
                                                                  paragraph, and indent the first line, through CSS.
                                                                  Within the paragraph, you can use the <br/> tag to do a line break.
                                                                  If you want to have an indent after the line break, but not at the beginning
                                                                  of the paragraph, you will have to do some trickery because this CSS is not
                                                                  yet supported.

                                                                  into it. You need to use <p> and <br/> tags to break lines. -->
            <ul>
                <li>Use an online tool like <a href="http://word2cleanhtml.com/" title="Convert Word Documents to Clean HTML">word2cleanhtml.com</a>.</li>
                <li>Or, probably the easiest:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Copy all the text from Word and paste it in your programming editor. This will remove all formatting.</li>
                        <li>Start adding the various HTML tags around the text.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>As an example of how to use HTML tags, you can look at the <a href="https://github.com/kabk/govt4-coding/blob/gh-pages/thesis-workflow-specifics.html">source code of this page</a>. It includes comments that explain various HTML tags. One thing that is not explained yet, is footnotes. We will get to that next week.</p>
            
            <p>To make adding HTML tags quicker, you can use a ‘Markdown’ program like <a href="http://25.io/mou/" title="25.io | Mou - Markdown editor for developers, on Mac OS X.">Moo</a>: this will automatically turn your blocks of plain text that are separated by a blank line into paragraphs.</p> 
            
            <h3>Getting your HTML onto GitHub</h3>
            <p>In the lesson, most of you got around to creating a repository on the KABK organisation, and adding bits of HTML. Here‘s a recap.</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>From the <a href="https://github.com/kabk">KABK organisation</a>, create a new repository by clicking: <img src="media/new_repository.png" width="140" height="40" class="noscale" alt="New Repository">.</li>
                <li>Fill in the title and choose ‘Initialize this repository with a README’.</li>
                <li>The new repository appears, empty except for a README.md file.</li>
                <li>Github for Mac or Github for Windows users can click the button ‘Clone to Desktop’.<br/>
                    Users of Source-Tree will have to do: menu &gt; Show Hosted Repositories (you might first need to login with your Github credentials). You will see all repositories that are part of <code>kabk</code>. Choose the one you just created, and ‘clone’ it.</li>
                <li>Now you have a copy of the repository on your computer. Find the folder, and add files to it.</li>
                <li>In Github for Mac/Windows, new files will show up as ‘changes’. In Sourcetree as ‘Files in the Working Tree’.</li>
                <li>To select the new files, in SourceTree drag them up to ‘Files staged in the index’. In Github for Mac/Windows just make sure there is checkbox next to them.</li>
                <li>To commit (add the changes to the local repository: first describe your commit with a message. In Github for Mac/Windows you can start typing directly, in SourceTree, first click ‘Commit’. Click ’Commit’ when you’ve finished your description and the change is added to your local history.</li>
                <li>To push it to the repository hosted on Github, in Github for Mac/Windows click the ‘Sync’ button in the top right corner—in SourceTree click ‘Push’.</li>
            </ol>
            

            <h3 id="publishing-html-as-a-webpage-on-github">Publishing HTML as a webpage on Github</h3>
            
            <p>You can share projects through Github, but you can also publish to the web. Like with this very page! The repository for this site is at <a href="https://github.com/kabk/govt4-coding">https://github.com/kabk/govt4-coding</a>, the corresponding web-address is <a href="https://github.com/kabk/govt4-coding">http://kabk.github.io/govt4-coding/</a>. To make it work directly from that address, a file index.html is needed in the repository.</p>

            <p>However, we need to do an additional step to start publishing to the web. This is because of the way Github has been designed. It is made for programming projects, which tend to have a separation between code and documentation. The web-publishing is usually used to publish documentation. Github uses a function of Git that allows to work on more than one variant of a project at a time, called ‘branches’. Normally, Github expects to code to be pushed to a branch called ‘master’ and the the documentation/web content to a separate branch called ‘gh-pages’. We want to only use the branch ‘gh-pages’, since our source code and our web content is one and the same.</p>
            
            <p>Dutch translation: Op Github projecten is er vaak een onderscheid tussen de code en de documentatie. De documentatie bestaat uit HTML en kan op internet worden gepubliceerd. Wij werken met alléén maar HTML. Daarom moeten we git vertellen dat de documentatie ‘branch’ onze belangrijkste ‘branch’ is. Wat is een ‘branch’? Git staat toe om parallel aan meerdere varianten van een project te werken. Als github een branch ‘gh-pages’ aantreft, wordt deze op internet gepubliceerd.</p>
            
            <p>To change branches, we’ll have to do some terminal wizardry!</p>

            <p>First open the terminal, and move to the folder where your git repository resides. For example (change with your username and location):</p>
            
            <pre>cd "/Users/camille/kabk/scriptie-map"</pre>
            
            <p>And then:</p>
            
            <pre>git checkout -b gh-pages
git push -u origin gh-pages</pre>
            
            <p>Your page will be online at http://kabk.github.io/scriptie-map/</p>
            
            <p>Through Github’s web interface, at your repository, you can change: settings &gt; default branch into gh-page.</p>
            
            <h3>Some tips in working with HTML, Git &amp; Github</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>One of the great advantages of Git is that it stores versions for you. Therefore you don’t need to store versions in separate files like this: <code>file_version1.html</code>, <code>file_version2.html</code>, <code>file_finalversion.html</code>, <code>filefinfinalversion.html</code>. Everyt time you commit, Git automatically stores the difference with the last version of the file you commited.</li>
                <li>The internet is case sensitive. <code>Kabk.gif</code> and <code>kabk.gif</code> are seen as two different files. When making links etc. you have to be consistent. Web developers often choose to use only lowercase filenames to avoid possible confusion. It is also best to not use accents in filenames, and to replace spaces with underscores.</li>
                <li>Your public website can be indexed by Google. If you prefer to keep it off Google while it is a work in progress, you can add the following code somewhere near the top of your HTML page: <code>&lt;meta name="robots" content="noindex"&gt;</code></li>
            </ul>
